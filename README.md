# Mitron-Bank-Product-Strategy-Banking-Project
Power BI Project (Codebasics Resume Project Challenge-8)
### Project Overview
Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad.

They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden its product offerings and reach in the financial market. 

AtliQ Data Services came to know about this through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to implement this project.
However, the strategy director of Mitron Bank, Mr. Bashnir Rover is skeptical and asked them to do a pilot project with the sample data before handing over them the full project. They provided a sample dataset of 4000 customers across five cities on their online spending and other details.

**Objective:** we have to guide them in tailoring the credit cards to customer needs and market trends. The successful acquisition of this project depends on the actionable, data-driven recommendations we provide to impress Mr. Bashnir Rover & his team.

This project is part of the Codebasics resume project [challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).
